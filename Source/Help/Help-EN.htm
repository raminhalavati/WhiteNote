        <h3> 1. Introduction to WhiteNote</h3>
        <p> WhiteNote is an application that presents musical note files (in XML form), suitable for visually impaired people. </p>
        <p> The name of this application is driven from Persian name for half note, which is called white note as it is like an empty circle. The name also has a reference to white cane which is the symbol of visually impaired. </p>

        <a id="E1.1."> </a>
        <h4> 1.1. The goal of WhiteNote </h4>
        <p>
            Visually impaired musicians always had to use braille musical notes. As production and reading of these notes is very hard, very few people use them, producers of these notes are very few, and at least in Iran, this is rarely done.
            As these notes are very hard to acquire and they can easily be ruined as they are made of heavy paper or cardboard, people usually do not share them. In recent years, they can also be generated by personal braille printers, but this is also not an easy solution because the printers are very expensive and have costly maintenance.
            Therefore, visually impaired musicians always needed to either copy a braille music manually, or ask sighted people to speak all musical notations and record for them.
            WhiteNote is developed to solve these problems and using that, people can easily copy and share music sheets as computer files, email them, or download them, and be independent in finding music and reading the notes.
        </p>

        <a id="E1.2."></a>
        <h4> 1.2. Why does WhiteNote use XML file format?</h4>
        <p> There are several applications that convert the images of scanned music sheets to computer files (OCR). These applications usually convert to music sheet into their own formats, but almost all of them also have the export to XML command. There are also several XML music libraries on the internet in which volunteers share music sheets that they have converted to XML format. </p>

        <a id="E1.3."></a>
        <h4> 1.3. What is XML Format? </h4>
        <p>
            A simple description of XML format helps in better understanding of how WhiteNote works. The XML file format is an standardized approach to record musical notes. XML format is quite hard to read for people and is usually used when two different applications want to share some data. In this case, as none of the applications know how the other applications keeps its data, they both use XML in which every data item has a description saying what it is.
            WhiteNote converts XML format to a text that is understandable for people and easy to use for visually impaired.
        </p>

        <a id="E1.4."></a>
        <h4> 1.4. What is MXL Format? </h4>
        <p>
            MXL (or Music XML) is the compressed form of an XML music file. WhiteNote is compatible with MXL as well.
        </p>

        <a id="E1.5."> </a>
        <h3> 1.5. Changes in this version </h3>
        <ul>

            <li> Support of screen reader applications like NVDA </li>
            <li> General changes in notes presentation </li>
            <li> Adding control mechanisms to move between notes and measures </li>
            <li> Adding control mechanisms to move between staffs </li>
            <li> Adding navigational sound alerts </li>
            <li> Adding user guide </li>
        </ul>

        <a id="E2."> </a>
        <h3> 2. Overview of WhiteNote</h3>
        <p> In WhiteNote, the user can use <a href="#E4."> shortcut keys </a> to study and memorize music sheet and play it on his/her own instrument. By the help of sound alerts, events like change of voices in polyphonic music or availability or unavailability of other music items can be found. Therefore it's good that the users gradually learn the reasons behind all sound alerts. </p>
        <p> WhiteNote uses specific methods to describe some notes or combinations which are different from braille format. Therefore we strongly recommend users to read section 3 on <a href="#E3."> 3. notes presentation in WhiteNote </a>.</p>

        <a id="E2.1."> </a>
        <h3> 2.1. Components of WhiteNote window </h3>
        <p> WhiteNote is currently composed of three main parts </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li> Menus Bar: This bar contains normal software menus and WhiteNote specific items.</li>
            <li> Descriptions Text Box: This text box gives you some general info about the movement.</li>
            <li> Notes Text Box: This is the main part of WhiteNote. In this text box, all music notes are presented in WhiteNote format which is measure by measure and staff by staff (For 2 handed instruments like piano separated by hands, for polyphonic music separated by voice).</li>
        </ol>

        <a id="E2.2."></a>
        <h4> 2.2. Screen Reader settings suitable for WhiteNote </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> It's best if you set your screen reader's punctuation settings on None, so that the underlined symbols that separate different parts of notes are not read. In NVDA, you can reach this settings with several pressing of NVDAKey + P. We recommend you not to save your screen reader's state in this mode, as it is only good for WhiteNote, and not for reading general text. Therefore it's best if it is not saved as default so that it returns to its normal state when you close WhiteNote.</li>
        </ul>

        <a id="E3."> </a>
        <h3> 3. Notes presentation in WhiteNote</h3>
        <p> We have tried to present music notes in a non graphical format (which should be definitely fully text based) as most compatible with braille music presentation, so that the users familiar with braille would use WhiteNote easily and also we use the decades of experience in braille music development, and not to reinvent the wheel! </p>
        <p> But there are minor differences between WhiteNote's method and braille music method, because our goal was not to produce a printable output, but to provide a way that notes would be readable on the same machine that the user is using, without the need to a braille printer. Therefore we needed to make some minor changes in notes presentation, like in presentation of polyphonic music or chords. </p>
        <p> We have also tried to present the normal page/system/line syntax in presentation of measures in lines, in systems, and in pages, to keep the connection between visually impaired user and the one who uses the graphical form, because in some cases, the musicians refer to pages and systems and lines instead of measure numbers. </p>
        <p> Also, to make WhiteNote usable at the same time for visually impaired and sighted users, it can present graphical and text presentation of notes at the same time. To do so, you need to install <a href="http:\\www.lilypond.org"> LilyPond</a> software.</p>
        <a id="E3.1."> </a>
        <h4> 3.1. Definition of a note in non visual presentation of musical notes </h4>
        <p> Similar to braille music notation, we first show the Note name (C,D,...), then it's duration, and finally it's accent if there is any. All parts are separated by an underline. </p>


        <a id="E3.2."> </a>
        <h4> 3.2. Octaves' numbering method </h4>
        <p> Note that in WhiteNote, the 3 most bass keys of piano are considered octave 0 and then the most bass C of piano is octave 1. Therefore the middle C of piano will be octave 4. </p>

        <a id="E3.3."> </a>
        <h4> 3.3. Specific symbols used in WhiteNote</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Chords: When you reach an chord, WhiteNote gives you and "Chord:", and then chord's notes come surrounded by '[' and ']' signs. </li>
            <li> Arpeggio: Similar to chords, when you reach an arpeggio, WhiteNote gives you an "Arpeggio:", and then Arpeggio's notes come surrounded by '[' and ']' signs. </li>
            <li> Triplet: Similar to chords, when you reach an triplet, WhiteNote gives you an "Triplet:", and then triplet's notes come surrounded by '[' and ']' signs. </li>
        </ul>
        <table title="Specific Symbols used in WhiteNote">
            <tr><th> Symbol or Expression </th><th> Meaning or Presentation </th></tr>
            <tr><td> Time Signature </td><td> The graphical view of the time signature is composed of two numbers, one on top and one on bottom. The top number tells the number of notes in each measure and the bottom number tells the base note. In WhiteNote, Time signature is followed by top number and then bottom number. </td></tr>
            <tr><td> [ </td><td> Chord, Triplet, and Arpeggio notes are always surrounded by "[ ]" signs, and before an opening "[", we always have either "Chord:", or "Arpeggio:", or "Triplet:". </td></tr>
            <tr><td> ] </td><td> Chord, Triplet, and Arpeggio notes are always surrounded by "[ ]" signs, and before an opening "[", we always have either "Chord:", or "Arpeggio:", or "Triplet:". </td></tr>
            <tr><td> Voices with rest in several measures</td><td> If a voice has silence in several consecutive measures, you can move to that voice, but besides silence, you will hear the number of measures that silence is continued. </td></tr>
            <tr><td> Expression and Articulation signs like Legato and Volume </td><td> The beginning and end of these signs are specified in WhiteNote. The starting sign comes before the first note that should be affected by it and the ending sign comes after the last note that should be affected. </td></tr>
            <tr><td> Shifting the lines in polyphonic music </td><td> If the lines in a polyphonic music shift while you navigate it (like one voice would be rest for some measures or a voice starts after some measures) you will hear a voice alert that tells you to check the voices. </td></tr>
        </table><hr />

        <a id="E3.4."> </a>
        <h4> 3.4. Signatures text's Presentation </h4>
        <p> In WhiteNote, clef, key signature, and time signature are presented by their names. </p>
        <p> As default, on any change of current voice or staff, all signature texts are repeated, even though you would not be at the beginning of the movement or when a change has happened. To disable this feature, you can go to <a href="#E7.3."> 7.3. Option menu</a> and disable them. You can always bring them back temporarily by pressing “CTRL + H”. </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Clef: After the Clef word, you get the staff line on which the key resides. Clefs are presented at the beginning of the movement or wherever they are changed. Example: Clef_Treble </li>
            <li> Time Signature: In graphical presentation of time signature and in Braille presentation, we have one number on top and one on bottom, but in WhiteNote, we present them after each other, first the top one, and then the bottom one. Time signatures are presented at the beginning of the movement or wherever they are changed. </li>
            <li> Key Signature: In WhiteNote, Key_Signautre is followed by the notes that are flat or sharp. For example Key_Signature_F#_C# shows that F and C notes are sharp here. </li>
            <li> Voice Number: In polyphonic music, the voice number is presented at the beginning of the measure text. </li>
        </ul>

                <a id="E4.1."> </a>
                <h4> 4.1. Graphical presentation using LilyPond </h4>
                <p> WhiteNote can show graphical presentation of music sheets along with the text based presentation, so that when a visually impaired and a sighted users are using the application at the same time, they both receive their appropriate presentation.</p>
                <p> In this mode, when you navigate between different measures and voices in text presentation, graphical presentation updates automatically. You can choose to do this update manually and when needed to increase speed. </p>
                <p> To use this feature, you need to install <a href="http:\\www.lilypond.org"> LilyPond</a> software. To install it you can go to <a href="http:\\www.lilypond.org/windows">http:\\www.lilypond.org/windows</a> and download the latest available version and install it with all default options.</p>
                <p> It should be noted that graphical view is not yet completed and has some minor issues. </p>

                <a id="E4.2."> </a>
                <h4> 4.2. Adding Comments Features </h4>
                <p> You can add comments for your students for any measure/voice and give the comments file along with xml file to them. </p>
                <p> If there would be a text file with similar name besides the xml file (and extension of comments.txt), it will be automatically read with the xml file and whenever you reach a measure/voice that has comments, user is notified with a different sound alert and s/he can see them with hitting required keys.</p>

                <p> To cooperate in WhiteNote project contact us please. The major help for this project at this stage is production of XML files. You can send us your XML files so that we add them to our online library for public use. </p>
                <p> XML Files of most of famous classical music sheets can be found on internet, but XML files of learning books or Persian and pop music is rarely found online and are strongly needed. We are very much hopeful that volunteers help us in production of these files. </p>
                <p> Besides WhiteNote website (<a href="http://www.white-note.com"> http://www.white-note.com </a>) you can access Persian ESpeak programing group website (<a href="http://www.espeak.ir"> http://www.espeak.ir </a>) to get the latest news on other software developed for visually impaired in Iran.

                <h4> 9.1. How to produce an XML File? </h4>
                <p> You can create XML files by two methods: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scan your music sheet with good quality and store it in TIFF or BMP format. Although these formats produce very big files, but they are usually much better for OCR in compare to compressed files like JPG and PNG. To scan the sheets, use “Gray Scale” method and not “Black and White” to get the best quality. You can scan in 300 DPI and only if your program was not able to convert the sheets correctly, try higher resolutions. You can convert scanned images to XML using OCR applications like Photo Score or Finale. There are usually many mistakes in conversion process, therefore one must check the files after conversions and correct the mistakes using tools that usually these applications provide. </li>
                    <li> You can write your music sheet in an application like Sibelius or Finale and save the result in XML format. </li>
                </ul>

                <h4> 10. Introduction of some XML libraries </h4>
                <p> Music XML files are mostly not indexed by search engines like Google, so you'd better to go directly to XML Music libraries including the following ones taken from <a href="http://www.musicxml.com/music-in-musicxml">http://www.musicxml.com/music-in-musicxml</a> </p>
