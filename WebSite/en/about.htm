    <h3> 1. About WhiteNote</h3>
    WhiteNote is an application that presents musical note files (in XML form), suitable for visually impaired people. There are several applications that convert the images of scanned music sheets to XML or MXL formats. WhiteNote applcation can read these files and speak them. </p>
    <p> The name of this application is driven from Persian name for half note, which is called white note as it is like an empty circle. The name also has a reference to white cane which is the symbol of visually impaired. </p>
    <p> Visually impaired musicians always had to use braille musical notes. As production and reading of these notes is very hard, very few people use them, producers of these notes are very few, and at least in Iran, this is rarely done. As these notes are very hard to acquire and they can easily be ruined as they are made of heavy paper or cardboard, people usually do not share them. In recent years, they can also be generated by personal braille printers, but this is also not an easy solution because the printers are very expensive and have costly maintenance. Therefore, visually impaired musicians always needed to either copy a braille music manually, or ask sighted people to speak all musical notations and record for them. WhiteNote is developed to solve these problems and using that, people can easily copy and share music sheets as computer files, email them, or download them, and be independent in finding music and reading the notes. </p>
    <p> WhiteNote application is presented as freeware and open source and you can download it's source code from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/raminhalavati/WhiteNote"> GitHub.com/raminhalavati/WhiteNote </a>. </p>

    <h3> 3. Helping WhiteNote </h3>
    <p> To help in WhiteNote project or sending us suggestions and bugs, please contact <a href="mailto:info@white-note.com">info@white-note.com</a>. The major help that this project needs now is in preparation of music XML files. If you have created files that you want to be put under your name in our library, please send them to <a href="mailto:library@white-note.com">library@white-note.com</a>. </p>
    <p> You can create XML files by two methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Scan your music sheet with good quality and store it in TIFF or BMP format. Although these formats produce very big files, but they are usually much better for OCR in compare to compressed files like JPG and PNG. To scan the sheets, use “Gray Scale” method and not “Black and White” to get the best quality. You can scan in 300 DPI and only if your program was not able to convert the sheets correctly, try higher resolutions. You can convert scanned images to XML using OCR applications like Photo Score or Finale. There are usually many mistakes in conversion process, therefore one must check the files after conversions and correct the mistakes using tools that usually these applications provide. </li>
        <li> You can write your music sheet in an application like Sibelius or Finale and save the result in XML format.</li>
    </ul>
